            <p>I am a passionate solutions provider using Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML and
              my smile. Businesses need solutions through logic and great code in order to maximize their potential and being a team player towards this goal fulfills me in a way nothing else ever could. Creating value in places I occupy and forming genuine relationships with people I come across
              take up most of my time, it's an occupation I embrace every single day, and it's what pushes me to be a better developer.
            </p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, catch me doing burpees, exploring Seattle, writing poetry or making a new
              music playlist. Thank you for visiting my page, I hope we get to work together soon.
              </p>
